# Neural Network Based Detection of Driver's Drowsiness

# Project Aim
To build a system capable of detecting/classifying image dataset into categories(Drowsy/Alert) along with live testing of videos as input.

# Project Motivation
The purpose of this project paper is to devise a way to alert drowsy drivers in the act of driving. Most of the traditional methods to detect drowsiness are based on behavioural aspects while some are intrusive and may distract drivers, while some require expensive sensors/hardware. Therefore, in this project, driver’s drowsiness detection system is developed and implemented to aid drowsy drivers from falling asleep and to prevent accidents. The system takes images from the device as input. Using these image templates, the trained model starts execution and predicts/classifies whether the face of the person in the image is drowsy or alert. The proposed model used was VGG16 which achieved an accuracy of 99.93\% on trained image dataset.

# Abstract 
As we know, road transport is one of the biggest means of transportation in any country. According to the available statistical data, a total of 151,113 people were killed in 480,652 road accidents across India in 2019, an average of 414 accidents per day or 17 road mishaps in an hour. In a year, 40% of highway road accidents occur due to drivers dozing off which leads to an unfortunate mishap. A driver who falls asleep at the wheel loses control of the vehicle, an action which often results in a crash with either another vehicle or stationary objects. To resolve this issue, we need to understand the root cause of this pressing issue. Some of the common reasons might include:-

Fatigue: One of the reasons of drivers falling asleep can be fatigue. This might happen when the driver has been on the wheel for too long or if he has monotonous heavy work before the ride.

Alcohol Intoxication: Even small amount of alcohol consumption is enough to make the driver drowsy and cause distraction in driving.

Monotonous Road: Another common reason for drivers to feel drowsy or fall asleep is when the roads are without any features or turnings/curves and has the same view which can give the drivers a calming effect and would eventually make them drowsy.

Inopportune Time: Riding during inopportune times, such as during midnight can stimulate sleepiness in drivers.

After Food Consumption: Riding after ingesting a heavy supper or a meal can make the driver fall asleep anytime.

Taking Medication: Many drugs have a reducing reaction, like calming the nervous system, relieving pain, leading to drowsiness.
  
In order to monitor the state of drowsiness of the driver, following measures have been used widely:-

1. Vehicle-based Measures — A number of metrics, including deviations from lane position, movement of the steering wheel, pressure on the acceleration pedal, etc. are constantly monitored and any change or deflection is found in these measures that crosses a specified threshold indicates a significantly increased probability that the driver is drowsy.

2. Behavioral Measures — The behaviour of the driver, including yawning, eye closure, eye blinking, head position, etc. is monitored through the camera and the driver is alerted if any of these drowsiness symptoms are detected.

3. Physiological Measures — The correlation between physiological signals (Electrocardiogram (ECG), Electromyogram (EMG), Electrooculogram (EoG) and Electroencephalogram (EEG)) and driver drowsiness has been studied by many researchers over the years and have found that these measures are extremely dependable and accurate in detecting driver's drowsiness.
